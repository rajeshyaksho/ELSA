Welcome to your virtual storefront management system! With just a few simple commands, you'll be able to create, customize, and run your own digital store right from your terminal.

- To get started, navigate to the directory containing the program and type ant build to compile everything into a runnable format. Once that's done, simply type ant run to launch the program and step into your virtual store.

Every time you open the program, a brand new store will be waiting for you, ready to be filled with whatever products your heart desires. Want to start fresh? No problem. Simply open a new store anytime you're in the program.

The power is in your hands to create and customize everything from your customers to their orders, and even the computers and accessories you offer. Create your storefront to fit your vision perfectly.

And here's the best part: if you're particularly proud of your setup, you can save all the data with ease. Want to revisit your virtual store later? No sweat. Just open the existing store whenever you're ready to jump back in.

So what are you waiting for? Dive in, and start building your very own virtual empire!
